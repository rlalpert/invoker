Invoker!
Glorious invocation!
What joy it is beholding me!
Thus I invoke myself!
So begins a new age of knowledge.
Orbs light my path.
Fight me!

Enlightenment is mine!

Invoker!
Glorious invocation!
What joy it is beholding me!
It falls to me to inform you that this one is in the bag!
So begins a new age of knowledge.
Yes!
Avowedly!
I proceed.
Away hence.
Forthwith.
Thither I go.
Wellaway.
Concentration!
Unto battle.
So it is said.
Thus and so.
Of course.
Orbs light my path.
As needs be.
I'll keep it in mind.
I am committed.
Mindfully.
I'm well aware of it.
Fine.
Over yon?
With speed.
'Tis tedious.
This bores me.
Such tedium.
Attack!
Nigh unto death!
Athwart my path.
Ill luck upon you.
Fight me!
You dare fight me?
Hearken unto me.
Knowledge is power!
The learned one strikes.
Who threatens my concentration?
I'll not be interrupted.
An honor to fight me.
You should be more fully aware of me!
Whithersoever you go, I follow.
Prepare your mind for death!
One of my favorites.
Spherical sorcery!
Behold!
A rich tradition.
Drawn from deep within.
From the great mystery.
A spell I well remember.

Plucked from the Arcanery.
My mind is my Arcanery.
An incantation long remembered.
A charming hex.
Enlightenment stands ready!
Words of power.
Witness true sorcery!
Augury abounds.
Arcana known only to me!
This spell works nowise!
This magic…disappoints.
My memory failed me.
Did I miscast?
My concentration—shattered!
Did I mix my magics?
Words fail me…
Ruinous, ill-fated spell.
Perturbations!
Lamentable.
Infelicitous!
The errant cosmos works against me!
No matter.

Cause for my enemies to dwell on me exclusively!
Vital attainment!
Enlightenment is mine!
The bliss of comprehension!

Did I hear a squeak?
I must have stepped on something.
Whatever that was, twas scarcely worth my notice.
Whosoever stands against me, stands briefly.
Fools die… as you well know.
Give it not a second thought.
Mark these words: they're the last you'll hear.
Your ignorance ensured your demise.
You'd have done better to clothe yourself in knowledge, for all the good your scraps of armor did you.
You die as you lived: insipid and ignorant.
You were no match for my powers. But then, who is?
Like a match already dim and damp, your mind snuffs out.
I outlive another.
He he he he he he he.
Ha ha ha ha ha.
He he ha ha ha ha ha.

First blood, as indeed I am first in everything!
Insipid.
I've forgotten you already.
Peculiar.
Gold for little toil.
Such abnegation.
Profitable engagement.
Well gotten gains.
A small annihilation.
As I will.
So mote it be.
Denied!
Denied!
All things fall.
Short-sighted of you.
No.
Methinks you wanted that.
Demised.
Tis nuncupatory!
It's all the same to me.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
Ho ha ha ha ha ha ha.
I will commit this to memory.
With mind alone, I have made this a reality.
Aeons have I waited, and saved, for this.
Blink dagger!
Dagger of the mind.
Ah, scepter!
Ancient scepter.
Scythe of Vyse!
Heart of Tarrasque!
Boots of Travel!
Shiva's Guard!
Bloodstone!
Veil of Discord!
Linken's Sphere!
Another Sphere!
Immortality!
For ages more!
No!
Darkness and ignorance take you all!
My magics die with me.
An end to ages of learning…
The archives of time are lost with me.
Outside my mind, nothing is real.
All that matters, perishes with me.
It was…not enough.
Forget me not!
Wex…Quas…Exorrr…aggghhh…
Dead loss.
The final tabulation.
Put me out of your mind.
I return with nary a mark upon me.
I remember now what I was about.
I shall be mindful, make no mistake.
Recalled from the yon side of death.
The universe was not the same without me.
With my return, the cosmos is restored.
All knowledge is parallel.
A line without beginning, a line without end.
From the source of self-knowledge, the well of creation, I return.
Knowing me… knowing you.
Remember me, for I will remember you!
Death is but a lapse in my concentration…
I will recall you at a later point.
I will think upon this for a time.
Be mindful of your purpose.
What need have I for this?
Well gotten gains.
Double damage!
Redoubled concentration.
Haste!
Still, not as swift as the speed of my thoughts.
Illusion!
I'm betwixt myself.
Invisibility!
I have orbs for this.
Regeneration!
Vitality, like my knowledge, a well that never empties.
Not yet.
I'm not ready.
It's not time yet.
Not yet.
I'm not ready.
It's not time yet.
Not yet.
I'm not ready.
It's not time yet.
Out of mana.
No mana.
Not enough mana.
Out of mana.
No mana.
Not enough mana.
Out of mana.
No mana.
Not enough mana.
Can't you see I'm under attack?!
I'm under attack!
Oh!
Oh!
Ah!
Eh!
Oh!
Ow!
Oh!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Oh!
Ow!
All can be known, and known by me.
The universe depends on what I can remember of it.
From the first point was begat a line. From this line was begat a world. And that first point was one I made.
Throughout the aeons I have been known by many names…but my true name of power…is Carl.
Behold before you, the illustrious, the imperious, ingenious arch-mage… CARL.
Carl!
Why thank you.
Grace to you.
Why thank you!
